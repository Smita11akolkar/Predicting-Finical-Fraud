# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. Fraud detection is a critical application in finance and banking, where identifying suspicious activities can prevent financial losses and improve trust in digital transactions.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers  
   - Feature scaling and normalization  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized transaction patterns  
   - Compared legitimate vs fraudulent transactions  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Trained machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  

4. **Results**  
   - Identified best-performing model for fraud detection  
   - Highlighted key insights and challenges  

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high precision and recall to minimize false positives/negatives.  
- Best model: *(Decision Tree, e.g., Decision Tree with 99.97% ROC-AUC)*  

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Use deep learning methods (e.g., LSTMs, Autoencoders).  
- Handle data imbalance with SMOTE or advanced sampling techniques.  
- Deploy model as an API for real-time fraud detection.
